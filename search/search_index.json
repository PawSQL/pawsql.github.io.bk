However, as you write your documentation, you may reach a point where small adjustments are necessary to preserve your brand's style. Adding assets \u00b6 MkDocs provides several ways to customize a theme. In order to make a few small tweaks to Material for MkDocs, you can just add CSS and JavaScript files to the docs directory. Additional CSS \u00b6 If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements, you can do this in a separate style sheet. The easiest way is by creating a new style sheet file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.css \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Additional JavaScript \u00b6 If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to your theme, create a new JavaScript file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 javascripts/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.js \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js Extending the theme \u00b6 If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some parts), you can extend the theme. MkDocs supports theme extension , an easy way to override parts of Material for MkDocs without forking from git. This ensures that you can update to the latest version more easily. Setup and theme structure \u00b6 Enable Material for MkDocs as usual in mkdocs.yml , and create a new folder for overrides which you then reference using the custom_dir setting: theme : name : material custom_dir : overrides Theme extension prerequisites As the custom_dir setting is used for the theme extension process, Material for MkDocs needs to be installed via pip and referenced with the name setting in mkdocs.yml . It will not work when cloning from git . The structure in the overrides directory must mirror the directory structure of the original theme, as any file in the overrides directory will replace the file with the same name which is part of the original theme. Besides, further assets may also be put in the overrides directory: . \u251c\u2500 .icons/ # Bundled icon sets \u251c\u2500 assets/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 images/ # Images and icons \u2502 \u251c\u2500 javascripts/ # JavaScript files \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ # Style sheets \u251c\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 integrations/ # Third-party integrations \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500 analytics/ # Analytics integrations \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500 analytics.html # Analytics setup \u2502 \u251c\u2500 languages/ # Translation languages \u2502 \u251c\u2500 content.html # Page content \u2502 \u251c\u2500 copyright.html # Copyright and theme information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 footer.html # Footer bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 header.html # Header bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language.html # Translation setup \u2502 \u251c\u2500 logo.html # Logo in header and sidebar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav.html # Main navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav-item.html # Main navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 palette.html # Color palette \u2502 \u251c\u2500 search.html # Search interface \u2502 \u251c\u2500 social.html # Social links \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source.html # Repository information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source-file.html # Source file information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs.html # Tabs navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs-item.html # Tabs navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 toc.html # Table of contents \u2502 \u2514\u2500 toc-item.html # Table of contents item \u251c\u2500 404 .html # 404 error page \u251c\u2500 base.html # Base template \u2514\u2500 main.html # Default page Overriding partials \u00b6 In order to override a partial, we can replace it with a file of the same name and location in the overrides directory. For example, to replace the original footer.html partial, create a new footer.html partial in the overrides directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 footer.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done with any file. Overriding blocks recommended \u00b6 Besides overriding partials, it's also possible to override (and extend) template blocks, which are defined inside the templates and wrap specific features. In order to set up block overrides, create a main.html file inside the overrides directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 main.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, e.g. to override the site title, add the following lines to main.html : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} < title > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet </ title > {% endblock %} The following template blocks are provided by the theme: Block name Purpose analytics Wraps the Google Analytics integration announce Wraps the announcement bar config Wraps the JavaScript application config content Wraps the main content extrahead Empty block to add custom meta tags fonts Wraps the font definitions footer Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright header Wraps the fixed header bar hero Wraps the hero teaser (if available) htmltitle Wraps the <title> tag libs Wraps the JavaScript libraries (header) outdated Wraps the version warning scripts Wraps the JavaScript application (footer) site_meta Wraps the meta tags in the document head site_nav Wraps the site navigation and table of contents styles Wraps the style sheets (also extra sources) tabs Wraps the tabs navigation (if available) Theme development \u00b6 Material for MkDocs is built on top of TypeScript , RxJS and SASS , and uses a lean, custom build process to put everything together. 1 If you want to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments directly in the source of the theme and recompile it. Environment setup \u00b6 In order to start development on Material for MkDocs, a Node.js version of at least 14 is required. First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: cd mkdocs-material pip install -e . pip install mkdocs-minify-plugin pip install mkdocs-redirects npm install Development mode \u00b6 Start the watcher with: npm start Then, in a second terminal window, start the MkDocs live preview server with: mkdocs serve --watch-theme Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see this very documentation in front of you. Automatically generated files Never make any changes in the material directory, as the contents of this directory are automatically generated from the src directory and will be overwritten when the theme is built. Building the theme \u00b6 When you're finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking: npm run build # (1)! While this command will build all theme files, it will skip the overrides used in Material for MkDocs' own documentation which are not distributed with the theme. If you forked the theme and want to build the overrides as well, use: npm run build:all This will take longer, as now the icon search index, schema files, as well as additional style sheet and JavaScript files are built. This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all style sheets and JavaScript files. After the command exits, the compiled files are located in the material directory. When running mkdocs build , you should now see your changes to the original theme. Prior to 7.0.0 the build was based on Webpack, resulting in occasional broken builds due to incompatibilities with loaders and plugins. Therefore, we decided to swap Webpack for a leaner solution which is now based on RxJS as the application itself. This allowed for the pruning of more than 500 dependencies (~30% less). \u21a9","title":"Customization"},{"location":"customization/#customization","text":"Project documentation is as diverse as the projects themselves and Material for MkDocs is a great starting point for making it look beautiful.

While this command will build all theme files, it will skip the overrides used in Material for MkDocs' own documentation which are not distributed with the theme. If you forked the theme and want to build the overrides as well, use: npm run build:all This will take longer, as now the icon search index, schema files, as well as additional style sheet and JavaScript files are built. This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all style sheets and JavaScript files. After the command exits, the compiled files are located in the material directory. When running mkdocs build , you should now see your changes to the original theme. Prior to 7.0.0 the build was based on Webpack, resulting in occasional broken builds due to incompatibilities with loaders and plugins. Therefore, we decided to swap Webpack for a leaner solution which is now based on RxJS as the application itself.

The fix includes a mandatory change of the base font-size from 10px to 20px which means all rem values needed to be updated. Within the theme, px to rem calculation is now encapsulated in a new function called px2rem which is part of the SASS code base. If you use Material for MkDocs with custom CSS that is based on rem values, note that those values must now be divided by 2. Now, 1.0rem doesn't map to 10px , but 20px . To learn more about the problem and implications, please refer to #911 in which the problem was discovered and fixed. Changes to mkdocs.yml \u00b6 None.

Martin Donath \u00b7 @squidfunk September 26, 2021 \u00b7 5 min read \u00b7 7.3.0+insiders-3.1.1 Two weeks ago, Material for MkDocs Insiders shipped a brand new search plugin , yielding massive improvements in usability , but also in speed and size of the search index. Interestingly, as discussed in the previous blog article, we only scratched the surface of what's now possible. This release brings some useful features that enhance the writing experience, allowing for more fine-grained control of what pages, sections and blocks of a Markdown file should be indexed by the built-in search functionality. The following section discusses existing solutions for excluding pages and sections from the search index. If you immediately want to learn what's new, skip to the section just after that . Prior art \u00b6 MkDocs has a rich and thriving ecosystem of plugins , and it comes as no surprise that there's already a fantastic plugin by @chrieke to exclude specific sections of a Markdown file \u2013 the mkdocs-exclude-search plugin. It can be installed with: pip install mkdocs-exclude-search How it works : the plugin post-processes the search_index.json file that is generated by the built-in search plugin, giving the author the ability to exclude certain pages and sections by adding a few lines of configuration to mkdocs.yml . An example: plugins : - search - exclude-search : exclude : - page.md - page.md#section - directory/* - /*/page.md It's easy to see that the plugin follows a configuration-centric approach, which adds support for advanced filtering techniques like infix- and suffix-filtering using wildcards. While this is a very powerful idea, it comes with some downsides: Exclusion patterns and content are not co-located : exclusion patterns need to be defined in mkdocs.yml , and not as part of the respective document or section to be excluded. This might result in stale exclusion patterns, leading to unintended behavior: When a headline is changed, its slug (permalink) also changes, which might suddenly match (or unmatch) a pattern, e.g., when an author fixes a typo in a headline. As exclusion patterns support the use of wildcards, different authors might overwrite each other's patterns without any immediate feedback since the plugin does only report the number of excluded documents \u2013 not what has been excluded. 1 Exclusion control might be too coarse : The mkdocs-exclude-search plugin only allows for the exclusion of pages and sections. It's not possible to exclude parts of a section, e.g., content that is irrelevant to search but must be included as part of the documentation. What's new? \u00b6 The latest Insiders release brings fine-grained control for excluding pages, sections, and blocks from the search index, implemented through front matter, as well as the Attribute Lists . Note that it doesn't replace the mkdocs-exclude-search plugin but complements it. Excluding pages \u00b6 An entire page can be excluded from the search index by adding a simple directive to the front matter of the respective Markdown file. The good thing is that the author now only has to check the top of the document to learn whether it is excluded or not: --- search: exclude: true --- # Document title ... Excluding sections \u00b6 If a section should be excluded, the author can use the Attribute Lists extension to add a pragma called { data-search-exclude } at the end of a heading. The pragma is not included in the final HTML, as search pragmas are filtered by the search plugin before the page is rendered: docs/page.md search_index.json # Document title ## Section 1 The content of this section is included ## Section 2 { data-search-exclude } The content of this section is excluded { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"text\" : \"\" , \"title\" : \"Document title\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#section-1\" , \"text\" : \"<p>The content of this section is included</p>\" , \"title\" : \"Section 1\" } ] } Excluding blocks \u00b6 If even more fine-grained control is desired, the pragma can be added to any block-level element or inline-level element that is officially supported by the Attribute Lists extension: docs/page.md search_index.json # Document title The content of this block is included The content of this block is excluded { data-search-exclude } { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"text\" : \"<p>The content of this block is included</p>\" , \"title\" : \"Document title\" }, ] } Conclusion \u00b6 The latest release brings three simple ways to control more precisely what goes into the search index and what doesn't. It complements the already very powerful mkdocs-exclude-search plugin, allowing for new methods of shaping the structure, size and content of the search index. When the log level is set to DEBUG , the plugin will report exactly which pages and sections have been excluded from the search index, but MkDocs will now flood the terminal with debug output from its core and other plugins. \u21a9","title":"Excluding content from search"},{"location":"blog/2021/excluding-content-from-search/#excluding-content-from-search","text":"The latest Insiders release brings three new simple ways to exclude dedicated parts of a document from the search index, allowing for more fine-grained control.

It provides a solution to empower the users of your documentation to find what they're searching for instantly without the headache of managing additional servers. However, even though several iterations have been made, there's still some room for improvement, which is why we rebuilt the search plugin and integration from the ground up. This article shines some light on the internals of the new search, why it's much more powerful than the previous version, and what's about to come. The next section discusses the architecture and issues of the current search implementation. If you immediately want to learn what's new, skip to the section just after that . Architecture \u00b6 Material for MkDocs uses lunr together with lunr-languages to implement its client-side search capabilities. When a documentation page is loaded and JavaScript is available, the search index as generated by the built-in search plugin during the build process is requested from the server: const index$ = document . forms . namedItem ( \"search\" ) ? __search ? . index || requestJSON < SearchIndex > ( new URL ( \"search/search_index.json\" , config . base ) ) : NEVER Search index \u00b6 The search index includes a stripped-down version of all pages. Let's take a look at an example to understand precisely what the search index contains from the original Markdown file: Expand to inspect example docs/page.md search_index.json # Example ## Text It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even add [ links ]( # ), or even `code` : ``` if (isAwesome) { return true } ``` ## Lists Sometimes you want numbered lists: 1. One 2. Two 3. Three Sometimes you want bullet points: * Start a line with a star * Profit! { \"config\" : { \"indexing\" : \"full\" , \"lang\" : [ \"en\" ], \"min_search_length\" : 3 , \"prebuild_index\" : false , \"separator\" : \"[\\\\s\\\\-]+\" }, \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"Example Text It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { return true } Lists Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit!\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#example\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#text\" , \"title\" : \"Text\" , \"text\" : \"It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { return true }\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#lists\" , \"title\" : \"Lists\" , \"text\" : \"Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit!\" } ] } If we inspect the search index, we immediately see several problems: All content is included twice : the search index contains one entry with the entire contents of the page, and one entry for each section of the page, i.e., each block preceded by a headline or subheadline. This significantly contributes to the size of the search index. All structure is lost : when the search index is built, all structural information like HTML tags and attributes are stripped from the content. While this approach works well for paragraphs and inline formatting, it might be problematic for lists and code blocks. An excerpt: \u2026 links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { \u2026 } Lists Sometimes you want \u2026 Context : for an untrained eye, the result can look like gibberish, as it's not immediately apparent what classifies as text and what as code. Furthermore, it's not clear that Lists is a headline as it's merged with the code block before and the paragraph after it. Punctuation : inline elements like links that are immediately followed by punctuation are separated by whitespace (see , and : in the excerpt). This is because all extracted text is joined with a whitespace character during the construction of the search index. It's not difficult to see that it can be quite challenging to implement a good search experience for theme authors, which is why Material for MkDocs (up to now) did some monkey patching to be able to render slightly more meaningful search previews. Search worker \u00b6 The actual search functionality is implemented as part of a web worker 1 , which creates and manages the lunr search index. When search is initialized, the following steps are taken: Linking sections with pages : The search index is parsed, and each section is linked to its parent page. The parent page itself is not indexed , as it would lead to duplicate results, so only the sections remain. Linking is necessary, as search results are grouped by page. Tokenization : The title and text values of each section are split into tokens by using the separator as configured in mkdocs.yml . Tokenization itself is carried out by lunr's default tokenizer , which doesn't allow for lookahead or separators spanning multiple characters. Why is this important and a big deal? We will see later how much more we can achieve with a tokenizer that is capable of separating strings with lookahead. Indexing : As a final step, each section is indexed. When querying the index, if a search query includes one of the tokens as returned by step 2., the section is considered to be part of the search result and passed to the main thread. Now, that's basically how the search worker operates. Sure, there's a little more magic involved, e.g., search results are post-processed and rescored to account for some shortcomings of lunr , but in general, this is how data gets into and out of the index. Search previews \u00b6 Users should be able to quickly scan and evaluate the relevance of a search result in the given context, which is why a concise summary with highlighted occurrences of the search terms found is an essential part of a great search experience. This is where the current search preview generation falls short, as some of the search previews appear not to include any occurrence of any of the search terms. This was due to the fact that search previews were truncated after a maximum of 320 characters , as can be seen here: The first two results look like they're not relevant, as they don't seem to include the query string the user just searched for. Yet, they are. A better solution to this problem has been on the roadmap for a very, very long time, but in order to solve this once and for all, several factors need to be carefully considered: Word boundaries : some themes 2 for static site generators generate search previews by expanding the text left and right next to an occurrence, stopping at a whitespace character when enough words have been consumed. A preview might look like this: \u2026 channels, e.g., or which can be configured via mkdocs.yml \u2026 While this may work for languages that use whitespace as a separator between words, it breaks down for languages like Japanese or Chinese 3 , as they have non-whitespace word boundaries and use dedicated segmenters to split strings into tokens. Context-awareness : Although whitespace doesn't work for all languages, one could argue that it could be a good enough solution. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily true for code blocks, as the removal of whitespace might change meaning in some languages. Structure : Preserving structural information is not a must, but apparently beneficial to build more meaningful search previews which allow for a quick evaluation of relevance. If a word occurrence is part of a code block, it should be rendered as a code block. What's new? \u00b6 After we built a solid understanding of the problem space and before we dive into the internals of our new search implementation to see which of the problems it already solves, a quick overview of what features and improvements it brings: Better : support for rich search previews , preserving the structural information of code blocks, inline code, and lists, so they are rendered as-is, as well as lookahead tokenization , more accurate highlighting , and improved stability of typeahead. Also, a slightly better UX . Faster and smaller : significant decrease in search index size of up to 48% due to improved extraction and construction techniques, resulting in a search experience that is up to 95% faster, which is particularly helpful for large documentation projects. Rich search previews \u00b6 As we rebuilt the search plugin from scratch, we reworked the construction of the search index to preserve the structural information of code blocks, inline code, as well as unordered and ordered lists. Using the example from the search index section, here's how it looks: Now Before Now, code blocks are first-class citizens of search previews , and even inline code formatting is preserved. Let's take a look at the new structure of the search index to understand why: Expand to inspect search index Now Before { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#text\" , \"title\" : \"Text\" , \"text\" : \"<p>It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links, or even <code>code</code>:</p> <pre><code>if (isAwesome){\\n return true\\n}\\n</code></pre>\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#lists\" , \"title\" : \"Lists\" , \"text\" : \"<p>Sometimes you want numbered lists:</p> <ol> <li>One</li> <li>Two</li> <li>Three</li> </ol> <p>Sometimes you want bullet points:</p> <ul> <li>Start a line with a star</li> <li>Profit!</li> </ul>\" } ] } { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"Example Text It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { return true } Lists Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit!\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#example\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#text\" , \"title\" : \"Text\" , \"text\" : \"It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { return true }\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#lists\" , \"title\" : \"Lists\" , \"text\" : \"Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit!\" } ] } If we inspect the search index again, we can see how the situation improved: Content is included only once : the search index does not include the content of the page twice, as only the sections of a page are part of the search index. This leads to a significant reduction in size, fewer bytes to transfer, and a smaller search index. Some structure is preserved : each section of the search index includes a small subset of HTML to provide the necessary structure to allow for more sophisticated search previews. Revisiting our example from before, let's look at an excerpt: Now Before \u2026 links, or even < code > code </ code > : </ p > < pre >< code > if (isAwesome){ \u2026 }\\n </ code ></ pre > \u2026 links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { \u2026 } The punctuation issue is gone, as no additional whitespace is inserted, and the preserved markup yields additional context to make scanning search results more effective. On to the next step in the process: tokenization . Tokenizer lookahead \u00b6 The default tokenizer of lunr uses a regular expression to split a given string by matching each character against the separator as defined in mkdocs.yml . This doesn't allow for more complex separators based on lookahead or multiple characters. Fortunately, our new search implementation provides an advanced tokenizer that doesn't have these shortcomings and supports more complex regular expressions. As a result, Material for MkDocs just changed its own separator configuration to the following value: [\\s\\-,:!=\\[\\]()\"/]+|(?!\\b)(?=[A-Z][a-z])|\\.(?!\\d)|&[lg]t; While the first part up to the first | contains a list of single control characters at which the string should be split, the following three sections explain the remainder of the regular expression. 4 Case changes \u00b6 Many programming languages use PascalCase or camelCase naming conventions. When a user searches for the term case , it's quite natural to expect for PascalCase and camelCase to show up. By adding the following match group to the separator, this can now be achieved with ease: (?!\\b)(?=[A-Z][a-z]) This regular expression is a combination of a negative lookahead ( \\b , i.e., not a word boundary) and a positive lookahead ( [A-Z][a-z] , i.e., an uppercase character followed by a lowercase character), and has the following behavior: PascalCase Pascal , Case camelCase camel , Case UPPERCASE UPPERCASE Searching for searchHighlight now brings up the section discussing the search.highlight feature flag, which also demonstrates that this now even works properly for search queries. 5 Version numbers \u00b6 Indexing version numbers is another problem that can be solved with a small lookahead. Usually, . should be considered a separator to split words like search.highlight . However, splitting version numbers at . will make them undiscoverable. Thus, the following expression: \\.(?!\\d) This regular expression matches a . only if not immediately followed by a digit \\d , which leaves version numbers discoverable. Searching for 7.2.6 brings up the 7.2.6 release notes. HTML/XML tags \u00b6 If your documentation includes HTML/XML code examples, you may want to allow users to find specific tag names. Unfortunately, the < and > control characters are encoded in code blocks as &lt; and &gt; . Now, adding the following expression to the separator allows for just that: &[lg]t; Searching for custom search worker script brings up the section on custom search and matches the script tag among the other search terms discovered. We've only just begun to scratch the surface of the new possibilities tokenizer lookahead brings. If you found other useful expressions, you're invited to share them in the comment section. Accurate highlighting \u00b6 Highlighting is the last step in the process of search and involves the highlighting of all search term occurrences in a given search result. For a long time, highlighting was implemented through dynamically generated regular expressions . 6 This approach has some problems with non-whitespace languages like Japanese or Chinese 3 since it only works if the highlighted term is at a word boundary. However, Asian languages are tokenized using a dedicated segmenter , which cannot be modeled with regular expressions. Now, as a direct result of the new tokenization approach , our new search implementation uses token positions for highlighting , making it exactly as powerful as tokenization: Word boundaries : as the new highlighter uses token positions, word boundaries are equal to token boundaries. This means that more complex cases of tokenization (e.g., case changes , version numbers , HTML/XML tags ), are now all highlighted accurately. Context-awareness : as the new search index preserves some of the structural information of the original document, the content of a section is now divided into separate content blocks \u2013 paragraphs, code blocks, and lists. Now, only the content blocks that actually contain occurrences of one of the search terms are considered for inclusion into the search preview. If a term only occurs in a code block, it's the code block that gets rendered, see, for example, the results of twitter . Benchmarks \u00b6 We conducted two benchmarks \u2013 one with the documentation of Material for MkDocs itself, and one with a very massive corpus of Markdown files with more than 800,000 words \u2013 a size most documentation projects will likely never reach: Before Now Relative Material for MkDocs Index size 573 kB 335 kB \u201342% Index size ( gzip ) 105 kB 78 kB \u201327% Indexing time 7 265 ms 177 ms \u201334% KJV Markdown 8 Index size 8.2 MB 4.4 MB \u201347% Index size ( gzip ) 2.3 MB 1.2 MB \u201348% Indexing time 2,700 ms 1,390 ms \u201348% Benchmark results The results show that indexing time, which is the time that it takes to set up the search when the page is loaded, has dropped by up to 48%, which means the new search is up to 95% faster . This is a significant improvement, particularly relevant for large documentation projects. While 1,3s still may sound like a long time, using the new client-side search together with instant loading only creates the search index on the initial page load. When navigating, the search index is preserved across pages, so the cost does only have to be paid once. User interface \u00b6 Additionally, some small improvements have been made, most prominently the more results on this page button, which now sticks to the top of the search result list when open. This enables the user to jump out of the list more quickly. What's next? \u00b6 Our new search implementation is a big improvement to Material for MkDocs. It solves some long-standing issues which needed to be tackled for years. Yet, it's only the start of a search experience that is going to get better and better. Next up: Context-aware search summarization : currently, the first two matching content blocks are rendered as a search preview. With the new tokenization technique, we laid the groundwork for more sophisticated shortening and summarization methods, which we're tackling next. User interface improvements : as we now gained full control over the search plugin, we can now add meaningful metadata to provide more context and a better experience. We'll explore some of those paths in the future. If you've made it this far, thank you for your time and interest in Material for MkDocs! This is the first blog article that I decided to write after a short Twitter survey made me to. You're invited to leave a comment to share your experiences with the new search implementation. Prior to 5.0.0, search was carried out in the main thread which locked up the browser, rendering it unusable. This problem was first reported in #904 and, after some back and forth, fixed and released in 5.0.0. \u21a9 At the time of writing, Just the Docs and Docusaurus use this method for generating search previews. Note that the latter also integrates with Algolia, which is a fully managed server-based solution. \u21a9 China and Japan are both within the top 5 countries of origin of users of Material for MkDocs. \u21a9 \u21a9 As a fun fact: the separator default value of the search plugin being [\\s\\-]+ always has been kind of irritating, as it suggests that multiple characters can be considered being a separator. However, the + is completely irrelevant, as regular expression groups involving multiple characters were never supported by lunr's default tokenizer . \u21a9 Previously, the search query was not correctly tokenized due to the way lunr treats wildcards, as it disables the pipeline for search terms that contain wildcards. In order to provide a good typeahead experience, Material for MkDocs adds wildcards to the end of each search term not explicitly preceded with + or - , effectively disabling tokenization. \u21a9 Using the separator as defined in mkdocs.yml , a regular expression was constructed that was trying to mimic the tokenizer. As an example, the search query search highlight was transformed into the rather cumbersome regular expression (^|<separator>)(search|highlight) , which only matches at word boundaries. \u21a9 Smallest value of ten distinct runs. \u21a9 We agnostically use KJV Markdown as a tool for testing to learn how Material for MkDocs behaves on large corpora, as it's a very large set of Markdown files with over 800k words. \u21a9","title":"Search: better, faster, smaller"},{"location":"blog/2021/search-better-faster-smaller/#search-better-faster-smaller","text":"This is the story of how we managed to completely rebuild client-side search, delivering a significantly better user experience while making it faster and smaller at the same time.

For a long time, highlighting was implemented through dynamically generated regular expressions . 6 This approach has some problems with non-whitespace languages like Japanese or Chinese 3 since it only works if the highlighted term is at a word boundary. However, Asian languages are tokenized using a dedicated segmenter , which cannot be modeled with regular expressions. Now, as a direct result of the new tokenization approach , our new search implementation uses token positions for highlighting , making it exactly as powerful as tokenization: Word boundaries : as the new highlighter uses token positions, word boundaries are equal to token boundaries. This means that more complex cases of tokenization (e.g., case changes , version numbers , HTML/XML tags ), are now all highlighted accurately. Context-awareness : as the new search index preserves some of the structural information of the original document, the content of a section is now divided into separate content blocks \u2013 paragraphs, code blocks, and lists. Now, only the content blocks that actually contain occurrences of one of the search terms are considered for inclusion into the search preview.

It solves some long-standing issues which needed to be tackled for years. Yet, it's only the start of a search experience that is going to get better and better. Next up: Context-aware search summarization : currently, the first two matching content blocks are rendered as a search preview. With the new tokenization technique, we laid the groundwork for more sophisticated shortening and summarization methods, which we're tackling next. User interface improvements : as we now gained full control over the search plugin, we can now add meaningful metadata to provide more context and a better experience. We'll explore some of those paths in the future. If you've made it this far, thank you for your time and interest in Material for MkDocs! This is the first blog article that I decided to write after a short Twitter survey made me to. You're invited to leave a comment to share your experiences with the new search implementation. Prior to 5.0.0, search was carried out in the main thread which locked up the browser, rendering it unusable. This problem was first reported in #904 and, after some back and forth, fixed and released in 5.0.0. \u21a9 At the time of writing, Just the Docs and Docusaurus use this method for generating search previews. Note that the latter also integrates with Algolia, which is a fully managed server-based solution. \u21a9 China and Japan are both within the top 5 countries of origin of users of Material for MkDocs. \u21a9 \u21a9 As a fun fact: the separator default value of the search plugin being [\\s\\-]+ always has been kind of irritating, as it suggests that multiple characters can be considered being a separator. However, the + is completely irrelevant, as regular expression groups involving multiple characters were never supported by lunr's default tokenizer . \u21a9 Previously, the search query was not correctly tokenized due to the way lunr treats wildcards, as it disables the pipeline for search terms that contain wildcards. In order to provide a good typeahead experience, Material for MkDocs adds wildcards to the end of each search term not explicitly preceded with + or - , effectively disabling tokenization. \u21a9 Using the separator as defined in mkdocs.yml , a regular expression was constructed that was trying to mimic the tokenizer. As an example, the search query search highlight was transformed into the rather cumbersome regular expression (^|<separator>)(search|highlight) , which only matches at word boundaries. \u21a9 Smallest value of ten distinct runs. \u21a9 We agnostically use KJV Markdown as a tool for testing to learn how Material for MkDocs behaves on large corpora, as it's a very large set of Markdown files with over 800k words. \u21a9","title":"What's next?"},{"location":"blog/2021/the-past-present-and-future/","text":"The past, present and future \u00b6 2021 was a fantastic year for this project as we shipped many new awesome features, saw significant user growth and leveraged GitHub Sponsors to make the project sustainable.

This article showcases all features that were added in 2021 and gives an outlook on what's going to drop in 2022. Additionally, it provides some context on the history of the project. A little history \u00b6 In 2015, albeit 10 years in the industry, I was still quite new in Open Source. I wanted to release my latest Open Source project protobluff , a zero-copy Protocol Buffers implementation for C, which I've created as part of my former startup. As the project has a significant degree of complexity, I quickly realized that I was in need of good user documentation. After evaluating static site generators in general and Hugo, Sphinx and MkDocs in particular, I quickly decided that MkDocs seemed a good choice, as it was specifically aimed at technical project documentation and easy to use. Unfortunately, all of the available themes looked dated and given that I'm a very visual person, I just couldn't convince myself to call it a day. I had to build a theme. Months later, in February 2016, I released the first version of Material for MkDocs (and with it, protobluff , the project I wanted to release in the first place), and it looked like this: It was already fully responsive and overall, well, quite okayish, but barely customizable, as only the logo could be changed. Beyond that, it had no options: No color or navigation options, no instant loading, etc. The search was very rudimentary and only supported section titles: It's important to know that at this point in time I've built Material for MkDocs for protobluff , the project I was really caring about. Almost 6 years later, nobody knows protobluff, but this little side project has taken off. If back in those days, you would've told me big organizations like AWS, Microsoft and CERN, as well as extremely popular Open Source projects like FastAPI and Kubernetes will be using this project in the future \u2013 I would've declared you insane. I still find the success of this project quite surprising, as I thought that themes exist in abundance and are very much a solved problem. There's no glory in themes, no stars to earn (remember that I was new in Open Source, so this was the metric I was optimizing for), as there are thousands and thousands of options. However, as the years progressed, I learned that execution matters : although Material for MkDocs solves a problem for which thousands of solutions exist, it excels in a specific niche, and that niche is to be known as technical project documentation . Today, this project is not only popular but funded by almost 300 individuals and organizations, resulting in a yearly budget of more than $50,000. This allows me to set aside enough time for the development of new features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general support and still feels like a dream to me, as there are many failed stories of Open Source funding and people telling you: don't do Open Source, you'll be working for free. Making Open Source sustainable is, after all, possible in 2021. 2021 in numbers \u00b6 2021 was an exciting year, as the project has seen significant growth. 166k people visited the official documentation in 2021, totalling in 1,6m page views which is an increase of 83% when compared to 2020. The average visitor spends 1,5min on the site. While mobile phones make up 12% of visits, tablets only account for 0.6%.

Here's an excerpt of the features that will see the light of day in 2022: Instant previews : instant previews will render a specific page section inside a tooltip when hovering an internal link, which will allow to implement things like glossaries. Further support for improving glossary functionality will also be investigated. Text annotations : as a logical progression of code annotations which were added in 2021, authors will be able to add annotations to plain text, yielding excellent opportunities for side content. Of course, text annotations will be as easy to use as code annotations. Navigation pruning : to optimize large documentation projects, Material for MkDocs will introduce a new feature flag called navigation.prune that will lead to significantly smaller HTML files for documentation projects with huge navigation hierarchies. Navigation status badge : as an addition to the recently added navigation icon support, a status will be attributable to each page, allowing to mark a page in the navigation tree with an icon as new or deprecated . Custom status types will also be supported. Card grids : as a further component in the toolkit of technical writing, card grids will allow arranging content in grids, which is especially useful for overview pages.

Happy new year!","title":"2022"},{"location":"blog/2022/four_traps_null_processing/","text":"Four Traps of SQL Processing with NULL Values \u00b6 NULL value processing is the most error-prone for database application developers, mainly because we are accustomed to using binary Boolean logic to think, while the database's processing logic for NULL values is three-valued logic . In fact, the most flawed component in the database optimizers is actually the logic related to NULL value processing. Even mature database software, such as DB2/Teradata, still has more than 20% of the bugs related NULL processing. Paw SQL \u00b7 @pawsql Aug 5, 2022 \u00b7 10 min read \u00b7 Overview \u00b6 In this article, we analyze the root causes of the NULL value traps, and concludes a simple and effective logic to infer the final result. At the same time, we explain the applicable conditions and solutions for the four common scenarios in daily development work; Finally, three optimization rules related to NULL value processing in PawSQL Advisor are introduced and evaluated by examples. After reading this article, you will be able to cope with all the scenarios regarding to NULL value handling in your daily work. Code of Examination \u00b6 The following examination logic covers all scenarios for NULL values in SQL processing, and by understanding the following logic, you can avoid the NULL traps. The result of all comparison and arithmetic operators ( >, =, <, <>, <=, >=, +,-,*, / ) with NULL result is unknown The logical operations( AND, OR, NOT ) of unknown follows the truth values table of three-valued operations If the result of the operation is returned directly to the user, use NULL to represent unknown If the result of the operation is true or false as a condition during SQL processing, then the operation needs to be performed by the three-value logic, and the final result is determined by the following logic 4.1. {false\u3001unknown} -> false 4.2. {true} ->true In set operations such as UNION or INTERSECT , NULL values are considered equal to each other. Three-valued Logic 1 \u00b6 In logic, a three-valued logic (also trinary logic, trivalent, ternary, or trilean, sometimes abbreviated 3VL) is any of several many-valued logic systems in which there are three truth values indicating true, false and some indeterminate third value. This is contrasted with the more commonly known bivalent logics (such as classical sentential or Boolean logic) which provide only for true and false. Traps of NULL Values \u00b6 Comparison with NULL Values \u00b6 Conclusion : expr = null can\u2019t determine the expression expr to be null , and is null should be used to determine whether the expr is null. Suppose there is a customer table with following five columns, among which two columns ( c_nationcode , c_phone ) are nullable. CREATE TABLE customer ( c_custkey int4 NOT NULL , c_name varchar ( 25 ) NOT NULL , c_nationcode char ( 8 ) NULL , c_phone varchar ( 15 ) NULL , c_regdate date NULL , CONSTRAINT customer_pkey PRIMARY KEY ( c_custkey ) ); insert into customer values ( 1 , 'Randy' , 'en' , '13910010010' , '20210911' ); insert into customer values ( 2 , 'Mandy' , null , '13910010012' , '20200211' ); insert into customer values ( 3 , 'Ray' , 'us' , null , '20180902' ); If a developer wants to find out the customers with empty phones through the following statement, he won't succeed because the result of following statement is always empty. select * from customer where c_phone = null ; The correct way should be\uff1a select * from customer where c_phone is null ; Let's examine according to the Code of Examination , the predicate c_phone = null is evaluated to unknown ; then according to Rule 4.1, unknown is treated as false . c_phone = null -> unknown -> false ; 2. Case When expression with NULL \u00b6 Conclusion : case expr when null can't determine if the expression is null, the correct way is case when expr is null . Problems in the where or having clause are easier to detect and correct, while it is much more difficult to dectect null usages in case when expressions, either by human or by existing SQL auditing tools. For example, if we want to decode the nation code to nation name, and the code is null, we want to set nation name to China : select c_name , case c_nationcode when 'us' then 'USA' when 'cn' then 'China' when null then 'China' else 'Others' end from customer The above statement does not convert the country code to null to China . Because when null is actually an operation performed by an c_nationcode = null . The correct way to to do it should be: select c_name , case when c_nationcode = 'us' then 'USA' when c_nationcode = 'cn' then 'China' when c_nationcode is null then 'China' else 'Others' end from customer 3. NOT IN with NULL \u00b6 Conclusion A predicate of a not in subquery with nullable select elements will always be evaluated to false. Suppose we have an orders table where the customer id( o_custkey ) and order date( o_orderdate ) are nullable due to missing data. CREATE TABLE orders ( o_orderkey int4 NOT NULL , o_custkey int4 NULL , o_orderdate date NULL , CONSTRAINT orders_pkey PRIMARY KEY ( o_orderkey ) ); insert into orders values ( 1 , 1 , '2021-01-01' ); insert into orders values ( 2 , null , '2020-09-01' ); insert into orders values ( 3 , 3 , null ); Now we want to find customers without orders for marketing. The expected result is the customer whose c_custkey is 2 , and the query statement might look like this, select * from customer where c_custkey not in ( select o_custkey from orders ) In fact, the above query return nothing to us. The reason is that the o_custkey in the subquery has null values, and the processing logic of NOT IN is like this c_custkey not in ( 1 \uff0c 3 , null ) \u2192 c_custkey <> 1 and c_custkey <> 3 and c_custkey <> null \u2192 c_custkey <> 1 and c_custkey <> 3 and unknown \u2192 unknown -> false In fact, if there are null values in the result set of the subquery, the SQL will always return empty result set. There are two correct ways: Add a NOT NULL predicate to the subquery, that is select * from customer where c_custkey not in ( select o_custkey from orders where o_custkey is not null ) Rewrite the NOT IN subquery to the not exists subquery, that is select * from customer where not exists ( select o_custkey from orders where o_custkey = c_custkey ) Note : PawSQL Advisor adopts the first method to do rewrite optimization, but it is more powerful, PawSQL Advisor first determines whether the columns in the subquery may be empty, and if it is possible, it will recommend the rewritten SQL to the user. 4. ALL Subquery with NULL \u00b6 Conclusion : A condition of an ALL -qualified subquery with nullable select elements will always be evaluated to false. Suppose we want to find out the orders which are wrongly registered after the user is revoked. One of solution is this following query statement. select * from customer where c_regdate > ALL ( select o_orderdate from orders where c_custkey = o_custkey ) Similar to NOT IN above, this sql does not return the expected result due to the presence of NULL in the result of the subquery. The ALL operation is actually performed by comparing it with the returned result set, and then performing the AND operation, and the final result is unknown . While unknown as a condition to be evaluated is, the result is false .

Is this still possible? Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. Almost all new features and configuration options are either backward-compatible or implemented behind feature flags. When working with outside collaborators, it should be rarely necessary to change the general appearance of your site. Most Insiders features enhance the overall experience, e.g. by adding icons to pages or providing a feedback widget. While this features add value for the user of your site, they shouldn't be necessary for previewing when making changes to content. Currently, the only content-related features in Insiders that can't be properly previewed by non-Insiders users are: Annotations Card grids This means that outside collaborators are able to build the documentation locally with Material for MkDocs and when they push their changes, your CI pipeline will build it with Insiders. When using built-in plugins that are exclusive to Insiders, it's recommended to split configuration into a base mkdocs.yml and one with plugin overrides via configuration inheritance . See the getting started guide for more information. Payment \u00b6 We don't want to pay for sponsorship every month. Are there any other options? Yes. You can sponsor on a yearly basis by switching your GitHub account to a yearly billing cycle . If for some reason you cannot do that, you could also create a dedicated GitHub account with a yearly billing cycle, which you only use for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that). If you have any problems or further questions, please reach out to sponsors@squidfunk.com . Terms \u00b6 Are we allowed to use Insiders under the same terms and conditions as Material for MkDocs? Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license . However, we kindly ask you to respect our fair use policy : Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, privately fork or mirror it, but please don't make the source code public, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy. If you cancel your subscription, you're automatically removed as a collaborator and will miss out on all future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like . Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks . In general, every new feature is first exclusively released to sponsors, but sometimes upstream dependencies like Python Markdown Extensions enhance existing features that must be supported by Material for MkDocs. \u21a9 Note that $10 a month is the minimum amount to become eligible for Insiders. While GitHub Sponsors also allows to sponsor lower amounts or one-time amounts, those can't be granted access to Insiders due to technical reasons. \u21a9 Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs, you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly. \u21a9 It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com , stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations. \u21a9 If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable. \u21a9","title":"Insiders"},{"location":"insiders/#insiders","text":"Material for MkDocs follows the sponsorware release strategy, which means that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors as part of Insiders .

Requirements \u00b6 After you've been added to the list of collaborators and accepted the repository invitation, the next step is to create a personal access token for your GitHub account in order to access the Insiders repository programmatically (from the command line or GitHub Actions workflows): Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens Click on Generate a new token Enter a name and select the repo scope Generate the token and store it in a safe place Installation \u00b6 with pip \u00b6 Material for MkDocs Insiders can be installed with pip : pip install git+https:// ${ GH_TOKEN } @github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git The GH_TOKEN environment variable must be set to the value of the personal access token you generated in the previous step. Note that the personal access token must be kept secret at all times, as it allows the owner to access your private repositories. with docker \u00b6 In case you want to use Material for MkDocs Insiders from within Docker, some additional steps are necessary. While we cannot provide a hosted Docker image for Insiders 1 , GitHub Container Registry allows for simple and comfortable self-hosting: Fork the Insiders repository Enable GitHub Actions on your fork 2 Create a new personal access token 3 Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens Click on Generate a new token Enter a name and select the write:packages scope Generate the token and store it in a safe place Add a GitHub Actions secret on your fork Set the name to GHCR_TOKEN Set the value to the personal access token created in the previous step Create a new release to build and publish the Docker image Install Pull App on your fork to stay in-sync with upstream The publish workflow 4 is automatically run when a new tag (release) is created. When a new Insiders version is released on the upstream repository, the Pull App will create a pull request with the changes and pull in the new tag, which is picked up by the publish workflow that builds and publishes the Docker image automatically to your private registry. Now, you should be able to pull the Docker image from your private registry: docker login -u ${GH_USERNAME} -p ${GHCR_TOKEN} ghcr.io docker pull ghcr.io/${GH_USERNAME}/mkdocs-material-insiders with git \u00b6 Of course, you can use Material for MkDocs Insiders directly from git : git clone git@github.com:squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git mkdocs-material The theme will reside in the folder mkdocs-material/material . When cloning from git , the theme must be installed, so MkDocs can find the built-in plugins: pip install -e mkdocs-material Upgrading \u00b6 When upgrading Insiders, you should always check the version of Material for MkDocs which makes up the first part of the version qualifier, e.g.Insiders 4.x.x is currently based on 8.x.x : 8.x.x-insiders-4.x.x If the major version increased, it's a good idea to consult the upgrade guide and go through the steps to ensure your configuration is up to date and all necessary changes have been made. If you installed Insiders via pip , you can upgrade your installation with the following command: pip install --upgrade git+https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git Caveats \u00b6 This sections describes some aspects to consider when using Insiders together with Material for MkDocs to ensure that users without access to Insiders can still build your documentation. Built-in plugins \u00b6 When using built-in plugins that are solely available via Insiders, it might be necessary to split the mkdocs.yml configuration into a base configuration, and one with plugin overrides. Note that this is a limitation of MkDocs, which can be mitigated by using configuration inheritance : mkdocs.insiders.yml mkdocs.yml INHERIT : mkdocs.yml plugins : - search - social - tags # Configuration with everything except Insiders plugins Now, when you're in an environment with access to Insiders (e.g. in your CI pipeline), you can build your documentation project with the following lines: mkdocs build --config-file mkdocs.insiders.yml Sharing plugin and extension configuration If you want to share plugins or markdown_extensions between both configuration files mkdocs.insiders.yml and mkdocs.yml , you can use the alternative key-value syntax in both files. The above example would then look like: mkdocs.insiders.yml mkdocs.yml INHERIT : mkdocs.yml plugins : social : {} # Additional configuration above plugins : search : {} tags : {} Earlier, Insiders provided a dedicated Docker image which was available to all sponsors. On March 21, 2021, the image was deprecated for the reasons outlined and discussed in #2442 . It was removed on June 1, 2021. \u21a9 When forking a repository, GitHub will disables all workflows. While this is a reasonable default setting, you need to enable GitHub Actions to be able to automatically build and publish a Docker image on GitHub Container Registry . \u21a9 While you could just add the write:packages scope to the personal access token created to access the Insiders repository, it's safer to create a dedicated token which you'll only use for publishing the Docker image. \u21a9 The Insiders repository contains three GitHub Actions workflows: build.yml \u2013 Build and lint the project (disabled on forks) documentation.yml \u2013 Build and deploy the documentation (disabled on forks) publish.yml \u2013 Build and publish the Docker image \u21a9","title":"Getting started with Insiders"},{"location":"insiders/getting-started/#getting-started-with-insiders","text":"Material for MkDocs Insiders is a compatible drop-in replacement for Material for MkDocs, and can be installed similarily using pip , docker or git .

Query Type Database Vendor Connection Info Deduplicate with existing indexes What-if analysis validation Query Type \u00b6 Specifies the type of input SQL statements. Paw Index Advisor currently supports two type of input SQL statements. SQL files If this option is selected, it means the inputs are native SQL files; The detailed syntax and corresponding index recommendations are described in detail in SQL syntax and Indexes . Map files If this option is selected, it means the inputs are Mybatis' mapper configuration file, Paw Index Advisor will parse those file and permutes all possible SQL combinations. Paw Index Advisor uses an intelligent engine to infer the data type of placeholders in a mapper file based on their context and assign them a valid constant, enabling it to produce legitimate SQL statements for subsequent query statement structure analysis. Mapper files as input is very important for application developers, because in the early stages of application development, developers can not fully grasp the input combination of the front-end, the SQL business that can be combined can not be determined, this option can ensure that for all combinations, the appropriate index recommendation can be made to improve performance. Due to some of the combined SQL statements will never appear in the real production enviroment, and some useless indexes are recommended based those combinition. Therefore, it is recommended to use the Paw Index Advisor again after the application is on production, or in the UAT testing stage, with the real SQL as input through the querylog. Database Vendor \u00b6 Specifies the database type on which the SQL optimization is performance. PawSQL currently supports three database types: MySQL PostgreSQL Opengauss Other databases based on the MySQL/PostgreSQL client protocol are theoretically supported, but have not been fully tested. Connection Info \u00b6 Database connection information serves two purposes: Obtain the database objects, including database tables, column definitions, and existing index information. Tip: The database objects are crucial to query optimization. PawSQL SQL Parser uses them to resolve the table names and column names refered in the SQL statements, and they will be use in following query rewrite optimization and index recommendation. Verify the the rewrite optimization and recommended indexes to ensure that the they can be selected in the actual SQL execution plan, thereby improving sql query performance. Database host \u00b6 Ip address or host name of the database server Database port \u00b6 Port of the connection to the database server User \u00b6 User name to connect to the database server Password \u00b6 The password of the user connecting to the database server DefaultDB \u00b6 The default database name when connecting to the database server Database/schema List \u00b6 For MySQL type of databases, it's a string of database names, like tpch, tpds For postgres/opengauss type databases, it's a string of schema names, like schema_a, schema_b Deduplicate with existing indexes \u00b6 If this option is checked and the candidate indexes is covered by existing indexes, those candidate indexes will NOT be considered in the final recommendation. Tip: This option should be checked when you are not considering dropping existing indexes. This is common because the input SQL statements are not representative of all the queries running against this database. Therefore, only consider adding new indexes that are helpful for input SQL statements. If you can ensure that the input SQL statements contains all the queries running against this database, you can keep only the recommended indexes, in which case you can uncheck this option and use the newly recommended index instead of the existing index. What-if analysis validation \u00b6 If this option is checked, Paw Index Advisor will do a what-if validation to ensure that the recommended indexes are selected in the actual SQL execution plan to avoid recommending useless indexes. Tip: Checking this option should be very careful under production enviroments. Because for those databases without built-in what-if (virtual indexes)capability (Neither MySQL or Postgres), Paw Index Advisor does the what-if validation by creating recommended indexes and performing explain commands to retrived execution plan for exclusive analysis, and then dropping the recommended indexes.

Query Type Database Vendor Connection Info Deduplicate with existing indexes What-if analysis validation Query Type \u00b6 Specifies the type of input SQL statements. PawSQL Advisor currently supports two type of input SQL statements. SQL files If this option is selected, it means the inputs are native SQL files; The detailed syntax and corresponding index recommendations are described in detail in SQL syntax and Indexes . Map files If this option is selected, it means the inputs are Mybatis' mapper configuration file, PawSQL Advisor will parse those file and permutes all possible SQL combinations. PawSQL Advisor uses an intelligent engine to infer the data type of placeholders in a mapper file based on their context and assign them a valid constant, enabling it to produce legitimate SQL statements for subsequent query statement structure analysis. Mapper files as input is very important for application developers, because in the early stages of application development, developers can not fully grasp the input combination of the front-end, the SQL business that can be combined can not be determined, this option can ensure that for all combinations, the appropriate index recommendation can be made to improve performance. Due to some of the combined SQL statements will never appear in the real production enviroment, and some useless indexes are recommended based those combinition. Therefore, it is recommended to use the Paw Index Advisor again after the application is on production, or in the UAT testing stage, with the real SQL as input through the querylog. Database Vendor \u00b6 Specifies the database type on which the SQL optimization is performance. PawSQL currently supports three database types: MySQL PostgreSQL Opengauss Other databases based on the MySQL/PostgreSQL client protocol are theoretically supported, but have not been fully tested. Connection Info \u00b6 Database connection information serves two purposes: Obtain the database objects, including database tables, column definitions, and existing index information. Tip: The database objects are crucial to query optimization. PawSQL SQL Parser uses them to resolve the table names and column names refered in the SQL statements, and they will be use in following query rewrite optimization and index recommendation. Verify the the rewrite optimization and recommended indexes to ensure that the they can be selected in the actual SQL execution plan, thereby improving sql query performance. Database host \u00b6 Ip address or host name of the database server Database port \u00b6 Port of the connection to the database server User \u00b6 User name to connect to the database server Password \u00b6 The password of the user connecting to the database server DefaultDB \u00b6 The default database name when connecting to the database server Database/schema List \u00b6 For MySQL type of databases, it's a string of database names, like tpch, tpds For postgres/opengauss type databases, it's a string of schema names, like schema_a, schema_b Deduplicate with existing indexes \u00b6 If this option is checked and the candidate indexes is covered by existing indexes, those candidate indexes will NOT be considered in the final recommendation. Tip: This option should be checked when you are not considering dropping existing indexes. This is common because the input SQL statements are not representative of all the queries running against this database. Therefore, only consider adding new indexes that are helpful for input SQL statements. If you can ensure that the input SQL statements contains all the queries running against this database, you can keep only the recommended indexes, in which case you can uncheck this option and use the newly recommended index instead of the existing index. What-if analysis validation \u00b6 If this option is checked, PawSQL Advisor will do a what-if validation to ensure that the recommended indexes are selected in the actual SQL execution plan to avoid recommending useless indexes. Tip: Checking this option should be very careful under production enviroments. Because for those databases without built-in what-if (virtual indexes)capability (Neither MySQL or Postgres), PawSQL Advisor does the what-if validation by creating recommended indexes and performing explain commands to retrived execution plan for exclusive analysis, and then dropping the recommended indexes. This process consumes a certain amount of resources, and the execution time is relatively long, which may affect the business operation on the production servers.","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"pawsqladvisor/configuration/#configuration","text":"You can configure and control the execution process on the PawSQL Advisor plugin Configuration page.

Mapper files as input is very important for application developers, because in the early stages of application development, developers can not fully grasp the input combination of the front-end, the SQL business that can be combined can not be determined, this option can ensure that for all combinations, the appropriate index recommendation can be made to improve performance. Due to some of the combined SQL statements will never appear in the real production enviroment, and some useless indexes are recommended based those combinition. Therefore, it is recommended to use the Paw Index Advisor again after the application is on production, or in the UAT testing stage, with the real SQL as input through the querylog.","title":"Query Type"},{"location":"pawsqladvisor/configuration/#database-vendor","text":"Specifies the database type on which the SQL optimization is performance.

Therefore, only consider adding new indexes that are helpful for input SQL statements.

Material for MkDocs provides several different types of admonitions and allows for the inclusion and nesting of arbitrary content. Configuration \u00b6 This configuration enables admonitions, allows to make them collapsible and to nest arbitrary content inside admonitions.

The content of the block follows on the next line, indented by four spaces: Admonition !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title \u00b6 By default, the title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can be changed by adding a quoted string containing valid Markdown (including links, formatting, ...) after the type qualifier: Admonition with custom title !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Removing the title \u00b6 Similar to changing the title , the icon and title can be omitted entirely by adding an empty string directly after the type qualifier. Note that this will not work for collapsible blocks : Admonition without title !!! note \"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Collapsible blocks \u00b6 When Details is enabled and an admonition block is started with ??? instead of !!! , the admonition is rendered as a collapsible block with a small toggle on the right side: Admonition, collapsible ??? note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Adding a + after the ??? token renders the block expanded: Admonition, collapsible and initially expanded ???+ note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Inline blocks \u00b6 7.0.0 \u00b7 Experimental Admonitions can also be rendered as inline blocks (i.e. for sidebars), placing them to the right using the inline + end modifiers, or to the left using only the inline modifier: inline end inline Info Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. !!! info inline end Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Use inline end to align to the right (left for rtl languages).

Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Use inline to align to the left (right for rtl languages). Important : admonitions that use the inline modifiers must be declared prior to the content block you want to place them beside. If there's insufficient space to render the admonition next to the block, the admonition will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports.

Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus (1) I'm an annotation as well! in everything else \u00b6 The Attribute Lists extension is the key ingredient for adding annotations to most elements, but it has some limitations . However, it's always possible to leverage the Markdown in HTML extension to wrap arbitrary elements with a div with the annotate class: HTML with annotations < div class = \"annotate\" markdown > > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, (1) consectetur adipiscing elit. </ div > 1. :man_raising_hand: I'm an annotation! Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, (1) consectetur adipiscing elit. I'm an annotation! With this trick, annotations can also be added to blockquotes, lists, and many other elements that are not supported by the Attribute Lists extension. Furthermore, note that code blocks follow different semantics . Known limitations Please note that annotations currently don't work in data tables as reported in #3453 , as data tables are scrollable elements and positioning is very tricky to get right.

Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : anchor_linenums : true - pymdownx.inlinehilite - pymdownx.snippets - pymdownx.superfences The following sections discuss how to use different syntax highlighting features with Pygments , the recommended highlighter, so they don't apply when using a JavaScript syntax highlighter. See additional configuration options: Highlight InlineHilite SuperFences Snippets Code annotations \u00b6 8.0.0 \u00b7 Feature flag Code annotations offer a comfortable and friendly way to attach arbitrary content to specific sections of code blocks by adding numeric markers in block and inline comments in the language of the code block. Add the following to mkdocs.yml to enable them globally: theme : features : - content.code.annotate # (1)! I'm a code annotation! I can contain code , formatted text , images, ... basically anything that can be written in Markdown. Enabling code annotations for a specific code block If you don't want to enable code annotations globally, because you don't like the automatic inlining behavior, you can enable them for a specific code block by using a slightly different syntax based on the Attribute Lists extension: ``` { .yaml .annotate } # Code block content ``` Note that the language shortcode which has to come first must now also be prefixed by a . . Anchor links \u00b6 Sponsors only \u00b7 insiders-4.4.0 \u00b7 Experimental In order to link to code annotations and share them more easily, Insiders adds an anchor link to each annotation automatically, which you can copy via right click or open in a new tab: # (1)! If you Cmd me, I'm rendered open in a new tab. You can also right-click me to copy link address to share me with others. Usage \u00b6 Code blocks must be enclosed with two separate lines containing three backticks. To add syntax highlighting to those blocks, add the language shortcode directly after the opening block. See the list of available lexers to find the shortcode for a given language: Code block ``` py import tensorflow as tf ``` import tensorflow as tf Adding a title \u00b6 7.3.6 In order to provide additional context, a custom title can be added to a code block by using the title=\"<custom title>\" option directly after the shortcode, e.g. to display the name of a file: Code block with title ``` py title=\"bubble_sort.py\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` bubble_sort.py def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Adding annotations \u00b6 Code annotations can be placed anywhere in a code block where a comment for the language of the block can be placed, e.g. for JavaScript in // ... and /* ... */ , for YAML in # ... , etc. 1 : Code block with annotation ``` yaml theme: features: - content.code.annotate # (1) ``` 1. :man_raising_hand: I'm a code annotation!

Stripping comments \u00b6 Sponsors only \u00b7 insiders-4.4.0 \u00b7 Experimental If you wish to strip the comment characters surrounding a code annotation, Insiders adds a new syntax that allows for just that. Simply add an ! after the closing parens of the code annotation: Code block with annotation, stripped ``` yaml # (1)! ``` 1. Look ma, less line noise! # (1)! Look ma, less line noise! Note that this only allows for a single code annotation to be rendered per comment. If you want to add multiple code annotations, comments cannot be stripped for technical reasons. Adding line numbers \u00b6 Line numbers can be added to a code block by using the linenums=\"<start>\" option directly after the shortcode, whereas <start> represents the starting line number. A code block can start from a line number other than 1 , which allows to split large code blocks for readability: Code block with line numbers ``` py linenums=\"1\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` 1 2 3 4 5 def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting specific lines \u00b6 Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language shortcode. Note that line counts start at 1 , regardless of the starting line number specified as part of linenums : Code block with highlighted lines ``` py hl_lines=\"2 3\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` 1 2 3 4 5 def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting inline code blocks \u00b6 When InlineHilite is enabled, syntax highlighting can be applied to inline code blocks by prefixing them with a shebang, i.e. #! , directly followed by the corresponding language shortcode . Inline code block The `#!python range()` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. The range () function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. Embedding external files \u00b6 When Snippets is enabled, content from other files (including source files) can be embedded by using the --8<-- notation directly from within a code block: Code block with external content ``` title=\".browserslistrc\" --8<--\u200b \".browserslistrc\" ``` .browserslistrc last 4 years Customization \u00b6 Custom syntax theme \u00b6 If Pygments is used, Material for MkDocs provides the styles for code blocks , which are built with a custom and well-balanced palette that works equally well for both color schemes : --md-code-hl-number-color --md-code-hl-special-color --md-code-hl-function-color --md-code-hl-constant-color --md-code-hl-keyword-color --md-code-hl-string-color --md-code-hl-name-color --md-code-hl-operator-color --md-code-hl-punctuation-color --md-code-hl-comment-color --md-code-hl-generic-color --md-code-hl-variable-color Code block foreground, background and line highlight colors are defined via: --md-code-fg-color --md-code-bg-color --md-code-hl-color Let's say you want to change the color of \"strings\" . While there are several types of string tokens , they use the same color. You can assign a new color by using an additional style sheet : docs/stylesheets/extra.css mkdocs.yml : root > * { --md-code-hl-string-color : #0FF1CE ; } extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css If you want to tweak a specific type of string, e.g. `backticks` , you can lookup the specific CSS class name in the syntax theme definition , and override it as part of your additional style sheet : docs/stylesheets/extra.css mkdocs.yml . highlight . sb { color : #0FF1CE ; } extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Annotation tooltip width \u00b6 If you have a lot of content hosted inside your code annotations, it can be a good idea to increase the width of the tooltip by adding the following as part of an additional style sheet : docs/stylesheets/extra.css mkdocs.yml : root { --md-tooltip-width : 600 px ; } extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css This will render annotations with a larger width: # (1)! Muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch more space for content Annotations with numbers \u00b6 Prior to 8.1.0 , code annotations were rendered with markers showing the original number as used by the author. However, for technical reasons code annotation numbers restart each code block, which might lead to confusion. For this reason, code annotations now render as + signs which are rotated if they're open to denote that clicking them again will close them. If you wish to revert to the prior behavior and display code annotation numbers, you can add an additional style sheet and copy and paste the following CSS: docs/stylesheets/extra.css mkdocs.yml . md-typeset . md-annotation__index > :: before { content : attr ( data -md-annotation-id ); } . md-typeset : focus-within > . md-annotation__index > :: before { transform : none ; } extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Code annotations require syntax highlighting with Pygments \u2013 they're currently not compatible with JavaScript syntax highlighters, or languages that do not have comments in their grammar.

Grids are just perfect for building index pages that show a brief overview of a large section of your documentation. Configuration \u00b6 This configuration enables the use of grids, allowing to bring blocks of identical or different types into a rectangular shape. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : # (1)! - attr_list - md_in_html Note that some of the examples listed below use icons and emojis , which have to be configured separately . See additional configuration options: Attribute Lists Markdown in HTML Usage \u00b6 Grids come in two flavors: card grids , which wrap each element in a card that levitates on hover, and generic grids , which allow to arrange arbitrary block elements in a rectangular shape. Using card grids \u00b6 Sponsors only \u00b7 insiders-4.12.0 \u00b7 Experimental Card grids wrap each grid item with a beautiful hover card that levitates on hover. They come in two slightly different syntaxes: list and block syntax , adding support for distinct use cases. List syntax \u00b6 The list syntax is essentially a shortcut for card grids , and consists of an unordered (or ordered) list wrapped by a div with both, the grid and cards classes: Card grid < div class = \"grid cards\" markdown > - :fontawesome-brands-html5: __HTML__ for content and structure - :fontawesome-brands-js: __JavaScript__ for interactivity - :fontawesome-brands-css3: __CSS__ for text running out of boxes - :fontawesome-brands-internet-explorer: __Internet Explorer__ ... huh? </ div > HTML for content and structure JavaScript for interactivity CSS for text running out of boxes Internet Explorer ... huh? List elements can contain arbitrary Markdown, as long as the surrounding div defines the markdown attribute. Following is a more complex example, which includes icons and links: Card grid, complex example < div class = \"grid cards\" markdown > - :material-clock-fast:{ .lg .middle } __Set up in 5 minutes__ --- Install [`mkdocs-material`](#) with [`pip`](#) and get up and running in minutes [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Getting started](#) - :fontawesome-brands-markdown:{ .lg .middle } __It's just Markdown__ --- Focus on your content and generate a responsive and searchable static site [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Reference](#) - :material-format-font:{ .lg .middle } __Made to measure__ --- Change the colors, fonts, language, icons, logo and more with a few lines [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Customization](#) - :material-scale-balance:{ .lg .middle } __Open Source, MIT__ --- Material for MkDocs is licensed under MIT and available on [GitHub] [:octicons-arrow-right-24: License](#) </ div > Set up in 5 minutes Install mkdocs-material with pip and get up and running in minutes Getting started It's just Markdown Focus on your content and generate a responsive and searchable static site Reference Made to measure Change the colors, fonts, language, icons, logo and more with a few lines Customization Open Source, MIT Material for MkDocs is licensed under MIT and available on GitHub License If there's insufficient space to render grid items next to each other, the items will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports. If there's more space available, grids will render in items of 3 and more, e.g. when hiding both sidebars . Block syntax \u00b6 The block syntax allows for arranging cards in grids together with other elements , as explained in the section on generic grids . Just add the card class to any block element inside a grid : Card grid, blocks < div class = \"grid\" markdown > :fontawesome-brands-html5: __HTML__ for content and structure { .card } :fontawesome-brands-js: __JavaScript__ for interactivity { .card } :fontawesome-brands-css3: __CSS__ for text running out of boxes { .card } > :fontawesome-brands-internet-explorer: __Internet Explorer__ ... huh? </ div > HTML for content and structure JavaScript for interactivity CSS for text running out of boxes Internet Explorer ... huh? While this syntax may seem unnecessarily verbose at first, the previous example shows how card grids can now be mixed with other elements that will also stretch to the grid.

Usage \u00b6 Image alignment \u00b6 When Attribute Lists is enabled, images can be aligned by adding the respective alignment directions via the align attribute, i.e. align=left or align=right : Left Right Image, aligned to left ![ Image title ]( https://dummyimage.com/600x400/eee/aaa ){ align=left } Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

If there's insufficient space to render the text next to the image, the image will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports. Why is there no centered alignment? The align attribute doesn't allow for centered alignment, which is why this option is not supported by Material for MkDocs. 1 Instead, the image captions syntax can be used, as captions are optional. Image captions \u00b6 Sadly, the Markdown syntax doesn't provide native support for image captions, but it's always possible to use the Markdown in HTML extension with literal figure and figcaption tags: Image with caption < figure markdown > ![Image title](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/){ width=\"300\" } < figcaption > Image caption </ figcaption > </ figure > Image caption Image lazy-loading \u00b6 Modern browsers provide native support for lazy-loading images through the loading=lazy directive, which degrades to eager-loading in browsers without support: Image, lazy-loaded ![ Image title ]( https://dummyimage.com/600x400/ ){ loading=lazy } Light and dark mode \u00b6 8.1.1 \u00b7 Experimental If you added a color palette toggle and want to show different images for light and dark color schemes, you can append a #only-light or #only-dark hash fragment to the image URL: Image, different for light and dark mode ![ Image title ]( https://dummyimage.com/600x400/f5f5f5/aaaaaa#only-light ) ![ Image title ]( https://dummyimage.com/600x400/21222c/d5d7e2#only-dark ) You might also realize that the align attribute has been deprecated as of HTML5, so why use it anyways? The main reason is portability \u2013 it's still supported by all browsers and clients, and is very unlikely to be completely removed, as many older websites still use it.

Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : plugins : - privacy # (1)! Note that the privacy plugin should be located at the end of the list of plugins , as it will scan the resulting HTML for resources to download and replace. If a plugin after the privacy plugin adds further external assets , these assets will not be downloaded. If you need to be able to build your documentation with and without Insiders , please refer to the built-in plugins section to learn how shared configurations help to achieve this. The following configuration options are available: enabled Default: true \u2013 This option specifies whether the plugin is enabled when building your project. If you want to switch the plugin off, e.g. for local builds, use an environment variable : plugins : - privacy : enabled : !ENV [ PRIVACY , false ] externals Default: bundle \u2013 This option specifies what the plugin should do when encountering external assets. There are two options: while report will issue warning messages during the build, bundle will automatically download all external files and adjust all references: plugins : - privacy : externals : bundle If you've removed all external assets from your project via customization , it's still a good idea to enable the plugin and set the mode to report , as the plugin will make sure that there are no hidden external links in any Markdown files that were unintentionally added. Using report in strict mode will make the build fail when external assets are detected. externals_dir Default: assets/externals \u2013 This option specifies where the downloaded external assets will be stored. It's normally not necessary to change this option: plugins : - privacy : externals_dir : assets/externals externals_exclude Default: none \u2013 This option allows to exclude certain external assets from processing by the privacy plugin, so they will not be downloaded and bundled during the build: plugins : - privacy : externals_exclude : # (1)! - cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/* - giscus.app/* MathJax loads web fonts for typesetting of mathematical content through relative URLs, and thus cannot be automatically bundled by the privacy plugin. MathJax can be self-hosted . Giscus, which we recommend to use as a comment system , uses a technique called code-splitting to load only the code that is necessary, which is implemented via relative URLs. Giscus can be self-hosted as well. Excluding specific external assets can be necessary if they contain dynamically created or relative URLs, which can't be resolved by the privacy plugin due to technical limitations . Why can't Material for MkDocs bundle all assets by design? The primary reason why Material for MkDocs can't just bundle all of its own assets is the integration with Google Fonts , which offers over a thousand different fonts that can be used to render your documentation. Most of the fonts include several weights and are split up into different character sets to keep the download size small, so the browser only downloads what is really needed. For Roboto, our default regular font , this results in 42 *.woff2 files in total . If Material for MkDocs would bundle all font files, the download size would be in the hundreds of megabytes, slowing down automated builds. Furthermore, authors might add external assets like third-party scripts or style sheets that would need to be remembered to be defined as further local assets. This is the very reason the built-in privacy plugin exists \u2014 it automates the process of downloading all external assets manually to ensure compliance with GDPR. Note that there are some technical limitations . How it works \u00b6 The built-in privacy plugin scans the resulting HTML for links to external resources, including external scripts, style sheets, images and web fonts, and downloads them to bundle them with your documentation site. Every URL refering to an external resource, no matter if part of a template or Markdown file, is then replaced with the URL to the local copy. An example: < script src = \"https://example.com/script.js\" ></ script > The external script is downloaded, and the link is replaced with: < script src = \"assets/externals/example.com/script.js\" ></ script > Style sheets are scanned for external url(...) references, e.g. images and web fonts, which are then also downloaded and bundled with your documentation site.

You might want to: Ignore the .cache directory in your project, by adding it to .gitignore . When building your site for publishing, use a build cache to save the .cache directory in between builds. Taking the example from the publishing guide , add the following lines: name : ci on : push : branches : - master - main jobs : deploy : runs-on : ubuntu-latest steps : - uses : actions/checkout@v2 - uses : actions/setup-python@v2 with : python-version : 3.x - uses : actions/cache@v2 with : key : ${{ github.ref }} path : .cache - run : pip install mkdocs-material - run : mkdocs gh-deploy --force Limitations \u00b6 Note that dynamically created URLs as part of scripts are not detected, and thus cannot be automatically downloaded.

Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : plugins : - privacy # (1)! Note that the privacy plugin should be located at the end of the list of plugins , as it will scan the resulting HTML for resources to download and replace. If a plugin after the privacy plugin adds further external assets , these assets will not be downloaded. If you need to be able to build your documentation with and without Insiders , please refer to the built-in plugins section to learn how shared configurations help to achieve this. The following configuration options are available: enabled Default: true \u2013 This option specifies whether the plugin is enabled when building your project. If you want to switch the plugin off, e.g. for local builds, use an environment variable : plugins : - privacy : enabled : !ENV [ PRIVACY , false ] externals Default: bundle \u2013 This option specifies what the plugin should do when encountering external assets. There are two options: while report will issue warning messages during the build, bundle will automatically download all external files and adjust all references: plugins : - privacy : externals : bundle If you've removed all external assets from your project via customization , it's still a good idea to enable the plugin and set the mode to report , as the plugin will make sure that there are no hidden external links in any Markdown files that were unintentionally added. Using report in strict mode will make the build fail when external assets are detected. externals_dir Default: assets/externals \u2013 This option specifies where the downloaded external assets will be stored. It's normally not necessary to change this option: plugins : - privacy : externals_dir : assets/externals externals_exclude Default: none \u2013 This option allows to exclude certain external assets from processing by the privacy plugin, so they will not be downloaded and bundled during the build: plugins : - privacy : externals_exclude : # (1)! - cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/* - giscus.app/* MathJax loads web fonts for typesetting of mathematical content through relative URLs, and thus cannot be automatically bundled by the privacy plugin. MathJax can be self-hosted . Giscus, which we recommend to use as a comment system , uses a technique called code-splitting to load only the code that is necessary, which is implemented via relative URLs. Giscus can be self-hosted as well. Excluding specific external assets can be necessary if they contain dynamically created or relative URLs, which can't be resolved by the privacy plugin due to technical limitations . Why can't Material for MkDocs bundle all assets by design? The primary reason why Material for MkDocs can't just bundle all of its own assets is the integration with Google Fonts , which offers over a thousand different fonts that can be used to render your documentation. Most of the fonts include several weights and are split up into different character sets to keep the download size small, so the browser only downloads what is really needed. For Roboto, our default regular font , this results in 42 *.woff2 files in total . If Material for MkDocs would bundle all font files, the download size would be in the hundreds of megabytes, slowing down automated builds. Furthermore, authors might add external assets like third-party scripts or style sheets that would need to be remembered to be defined as further local assets. This is the very reason the built-in privacy plugin exists \u2014 it automates the process of downloading all external assets manually to ensure compliance with GDPR.

This can easily be achieved with an additional style sheet and a few lines of CSS: docs/stylesheets/extra.css mkdocs.yml . md-grid { max-width : 1440 px ; /* (1)! */ } If you want the content area to always stretch to the available screen space, reset max-width with the following CSS: . md-grid { max-width : initial ; } extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Prior to 6.2.0, navigation tabs had a slightly different behavior.

This is where Material for MkDocs deviates from other themes. The following section explains how search can be customized to tailor it to your needs. Query transformation \u00b6 When a user enters a query into the search box, the query is pre-processed before it is submitted to the search index. Material for MkDocs will apply the following transformations, which can be customized by extending the theme : export function defaultTransform ( query : string ) : string { return query . split ( /\"([^\"]+)\"/g ) /* (1)! */ . map (( terms , index ) => index & 1 ? terms . replace ( /^\\b|^(?![^\\x00-\\x7F]|$)|\\s+/g , \" +\" ) : terms ) . join ( \"\" ) . replace ( /\"|(?:^|\\s+)[*+\\-:^~]+(?=\\s+|$)/g , \"\" ) /* (2)! */ . trim () /* (3)! */ } Search for terms in quotation marks and prepend a + modifier to denote that the resulting document must contain all terms, converting the query to an AND query (as opposed to the default OR behavior). While users may expect terms enclosed in quotation marks to map to span queries, i.e. for which order is important, lunr doesn't support them, so the best we can do is to convert the terms to an AND query. Replace control characters which are not located at the beginning of the query or preceded by white space, or are not followed by a non-whitespace character or are at the end of the query string. Furthermore, filter unmatched quotation marks. Trim excess whitespace from left and right. If you want to switch to the default behavior of the mkdocs and readthedocs themes, both of which don't transform the query prior to submission, or customize the transform function, you can do this by overriding the config block : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block config %} {{ super() }} < script > var __search = { transform : function ( query ) { return query } } </ script > {% endblock %} The transform function will receive the query string as entered by the user and must return the processed query string to be submitted to the search index. Custom search \u00b6 Material for MkDocs implements search as part of a web worker . If you want to switch the web worker with your own implementation, e.g. to submit search to an external service, you can add a custom JavaScript file to the docs directory and override the config block : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block config %} {{ super() }} < script > var __search = { worker : \"<url>\" } </ script > {% endblock %} Communication with the search worker is implemented using a designated message format using discriminated unions, i.e. through the type property of the message. See the following interface definitions to learn about the message formats: SearchMessage SearchIndex and SearchResult The sequence and direction of messages is rather intuitive: SearchSetupMessage SearchReadyMessage SearchQueryMessage SearchResultMessage","title":"Setting up site search"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-site-search/#setting-up-site-search","text":"Material for MkDocs provides an excellent client-side search implementation, omitting the need for the integration of third-party services, which might not be compliant with privacy regulations.

While users may expect terms enclosed in quotation marks to map to span queries, i.e. for which order is important, lunr doesn't support them, so the best we can do is to convert the terms to an AND query. Replace control characters which are not located at the beginning of the query or preceded by white space, or are not followed by a non-whitespace character or are at the end of the query string. Furthermore, filter unmatched quotation marks. Trim excess whitespace from left and right. If you want to switch to the default behavior of the mkdocs and readthedocs themes, both of which don't transform the query prior to submission, or customize the transform function, you can do this by overriding the config block : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block config %} {{ super() }} < script > var __search = { transform : function ( query ) { return query } } </ script > {% endblock %} The transform function will receive the query string as entered by the user and must return the processed query string to be submitted to the search index.","title":"Query transformation"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-site-search/#custom-search","text":"Material for MkDocs implements search as part of a web worker .

If you don't want to use Docker, see the following section which explains how to install all dependencies on your system: macOS Windows Linux Make sure Homebrew is installed, which is a modern package manager for macOS. Next, use the following command to install all necessary dependencies: brew install cairo freetype libffi libjpeg libpng zlib As stated in the installation guide , the easiest way to get up and running with the Cairo Graphics library on Windows is by installing GTK+ , since it has Cairo as a dependency. There are several package managers for Linux with varying availability per distribution. The installation guide explains how to install the Cairo Graphics library for your distribution: Ubuntu Fedora openSUSE apt-get install libcairo2-dev libfreetype6-dev libffi-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libz-dev yum install cairo-devel freetype-devel libffi-devel libjpeg-devel libpng-devel zlib-devel zypper install cairo-devel freetype-devel libffi-devel libjpeg-devel libpng-devel zlib-devel Caching recommended \u00b6 The built-in social plugin automatically fetches the fonts you define in mkdocs.yml from Google Fonts, and uses them to render the text that is displayed on the social card. The font files and generated cards are both written to the .cache directory, which is used in subsequent builds to detect whether the social cards need to be regenerated. You might want to: Ignore the .cache directory in your project, by adding it to .gitignore . When building your site for publishing, use a build cache to save the .cache directory in between builds. Taking the example from the publishing guide , add the following lines: name : ci on : push : branches : - master - main jobs : deploy : runs-on : ubuntu-latest steps : - uses : actions/checkout@v2 - uses : actions/setup-python@v2 with : python-version : 3.x - uses : actions/cache@v2 with : key : ${{ github.ref }} path : .cache - run : pip install mkdocs-material - run : mkdocs gh-deploy --force Meta tags \u00b6 The built-in social plugin automatically sets all necessary meta tags, equivalent to the following two customizations, which you can set manually when you don't want to use it: Open Graph Twitter Cards {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block extrahead %} {% set title = config.site_name %} {% if page and page.meta and page.meta.title %} {% set title = title ~ \" - \" ~ page.meta.title %} {% elif page and page.title and not page.is_homepage %} {% set title = title ~ \" - \" ~ page.title %} {% endif %} < meta property = \"og:type\" content = \"website\" /> < meta property = \"og:title\" content = \"{{ title }}\" /> < meta property = \"og:description\" content = \"{{ config.site_description }}\" /> < meta property = \"og:url\" content = \"{{ page.canonical_url }}\" /> < meta property = \"og:image\" content = \"<url>\" /> < meta property = \"og:image:type\" content = \"image/png\" /> < meta property = \"og:image:width\" content = \"1200\" /> < meta property = \"og:image:height\" content = \"630\" /> {% endblock %} {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block extrahead %} {% set title = config.site_name %} {% if page and page.meta and page.meta.title %} {% set title = title ~ \" - \" ~ page.meta.title %} {% elif page and page.title and not page.is_homepage %} {% set title = title ~ \" - \" ~ page.title %} {% endif %} < meta name = \"twitter:card\" content = \"summary_large_image\" /> < meta name = \"twitter:title\" content = \"{{ title }}\" /> < meta name = \"twitter:description\" content = \"{{ config.site_description }}\" /> < meta name = \"twitter:image\" content = \"<url>\" /> {% endblock %} Usage \u00b6 If you want to adjust the title or set a custom description for the social card, you can set the front matter title and description properties, which take precedence over the default values.

Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : anchor_linenums : true - pymdownx.superfences # (1)! Highlight is used by the SuperFences extension to perform syntax highlighting on code blocks, not the other way round, which is why this extension also needs to be enabled. The following configuration options are supported: use_pygments Default: true \u2013 This option allows to control whether highlighting should be carried out during build time using Pygments or in the browser with a JavaScript syntax highlighter: Pygments JavaScript markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : use_pygments : true - pymdownx.superfences markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : use_pygments : false As an example, Highlight.js , a JavaScript syntax highlighter, can be integrated with some additional JavaScript and an additional style sheet in mkdocs.yml : docs/javascripts/highlight.js mkdocs.yml document $ . subscribe (() => { hljs . highlightAll () }) extra_javascript : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.7.2/highlight.min.js - javascripts/highlight.js extra_css : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.7.2/styles/default.min.css Note that Highlight.js has no affiliation with the Highlight extension. All following configuration options are only compatible with build-time syntax highlighting using Pygments , so they don't apply if use_pygments is set to false . auto_title Default: false \u2013 This option will automatically add a title to all code blocks that shows the name of the language being used, e.g. Python is printed for a py block: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : auto_title : true linenums Default: false \u2013 This option will add line numbers to all code blocks. If you wish to add line numbers to some , but not all code blocks, consult the section on adding line numbers in the code block reference, which also contains some tips on working with line numbers: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums : true linenums_style Default: table \u2013 The Highlight extension provides three ways to add line numbers, two of which are supported by Material for MkDocs. While table wraps a code block in a <table> element, pymdownx-inline renders line numbers as part of the line itself: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums_style : pymdownx-inline Note that inline will put line numbers next to the actual code, which means that they will be included when selecting text with the cursor or copying a code block to the clipboard. Thus, the usage of either table or pymdownx-inline is recommended. anchor_linenums 8.1.0 \u00b7 Default: false \u2013 If a code blocks contains line numbers, enabling this setting will wrap them with anchor links, so they can be hyperlinked and shared more easily: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : anchor_linenums : true The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use them at your own risk. See reference for usage: Using code blocks Adding a title Adding line numbers Highlighting specific lines Custom syntax theme InlineHilite \u00b6 5.0.0 \u00b7 Extension The InlineHilite extension add support for syntax highlighting of inline code blocks.

Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight - pymdownx.inlinehilite The configuration options of this extension are not specific to Material for MkDocs, as they only impact the Markdown parsing stage. The only exception is the css_class option, which must not be changed. See the InlineHilite documentation for guidance. See reference for usage: Highlighting inline code blocks Keys \u00b6 1.0.0 \u00b7 Extension The Keys extension adds a simple syntax to allow for the rendering of keyboard keys and combinations, e.g. Ctrl + Alt + Del .
